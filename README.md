# Loops in JavaScript

This repository contains a simple JavaScript script (`loops.js`) that demonstrates different types of loops and number manipulation techniques.

## Features

- Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
- Prints odd numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
- Prints numbers in reverse from 10 to 1 using a `while` loop.
- Implements a unique number reversal pattern using `while` loops.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download `loops.js`.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   node loops.js
   ```

## Code Overview

### Numbers from 1 to 10
A `for` loop is used to print numbers sequentially from 1 to 10.

### Odd Numbers from 1 to 10
A `while` loop is used to iterate through numbers and print only the odd ones.

### Numbers in Reverse
A `while` loop prints numbers in reverse from 10 down to 1.

### Reverse Numbers in Left and Right Pattern
A `while` loop is used to print numbers in a structured left and right reverse pattern based on a given number (15 in this case).

## Example Output
```
Numbers from 1 to 10 ->
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Odd numbers from 1 to 10 ->
1 3 5 7 9

Numbers in reverse ->
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Reversing the numbers in left and right
